# Project Title

JWT authentication tests for furthering my understanding of how JWT authentication works, as well as the process of creating a JWT for a user
for the purpose of safegaurding the user's critical information(i.e. password).

# Version 0.0.1

## Getting Started

Begin by either:
  1) cloning the "node-jwt-auth" [repository](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/node-jwt-auth/) to your local device 
  2) remixing this [glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/feather-pizza)
  
Steps if you cloned github repository:  
  1) you will need to install 3 pieces of software:  
    a) [gitbash](https://gitforwindows.org/)  
    b) [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)  
    c) [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community)  
  2)open 2 seperate git bash windows  
    a)window one:  
      - type cd to move to general directory
      - type mongod to initiate the server
     
    b)window two:  
      - locate the directory you cloned your version of the repository into
      - type "npm test" to make sure there are no issues with the code
      - type "npm start" to start up the local server
      
  3) open Postman  
    a) create a new postman session  
    b) for the url prefix input "http://localhost:8080/"  
  4) continue following instructions found in DEVELOPMENT.md

Steps if you remixed the glitch:
  1) click the project name to open a dropdown menu
  2) click "Remix This" button to create a remixed version of the app
  3) copy/paste the url in the dropdown menu into the url section of postman
  4) continue following instructions found in DEVELOPMENT.md
